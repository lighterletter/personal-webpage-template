    Applicant: John Gomez. "I made an attempt at writting my own code from scratch but ended up with a very 90's looking site that I wasn't happy with. After stopping by the office hours for some advice, I ended up using the template from the Ada Lovelace webpage and adapting some of my earlier elements from the site before, I am much more happier with the result now.

      		A 26 year old Queens native, I landed in the city from Colombia when I was just 8 years old. It was strange acclamating to the culture shock at such a young age, but an adventurous spirit and an unquenchable sense of wonder has led me to find solace in astronomy, computer science and the mysteries of the universe. Inspired by people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson">Neil Degrasse Tyson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai">Sundar Pichai</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, I'm following a career in tech, searching for answers while striving to improve life on earth while I'm at it.
